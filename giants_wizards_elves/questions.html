	<h1>Com Studies Reflection</h1>

	<p>Prior to taking this course I had absolutely no knowledge of basic coding whatsoever. I played around with Visual Basic for like an hour for a trial camp that I never ended up going to, so this course had really taught me a lot. At first I was nervous that the course would go too fast for someone who had never really worked with code before, especially with people with lots of people like Nick and Franco who had lots of experience working on computers, but I was extremely pleased that the class was for absolutely everyone, no matter their experience level. I learned how to write code for a basic html5 document. Html documents display content on a webpage. It’s plain, simple, straightforward, and shows the content as it is and only as it is. Some things we learned to code using html were links, images, lists, tables, and forms. We also learned about how to style the page using CSS. So, once you have all the content needed in your html document, you can make a style tag in your document and design away. You can add background images or colours, make it so you can change the texts appearance depending on if you’re hovering over it, if it’s in a certain spot, if it’s assigned to a certain class, and so much more. One of my favourite things to learn in the class was Javascript. Javascript opened up a whole new world of code for me and totally captured all of my attention. Using Javascript, you could use things as simple as alerts, prompts, for loops, while loops, and functions to create a choose your own adventure game. I loved how after learning only some simple lines of code I was able to manipulate the computer in such an amazing way.</p>

	<p>The assignment I’m most proud of is coding basics (mine was called Pokemon Violet). I’m proud of this project because I was able to create a real game that I personally found a lot of fun. It wasn’t a dicky sort of simple game, it was a real game with a computer controlled opponent, it counted life points for each pokemon, and considered pokemon weaknesses while dealing damage. It took me a really long time to finish, but I was really just happy that the end result worked so well. I had to change quite a few concepts from my original idea so I would be able to actually code it using the knowledge I already had, but I was still very proud of the finished product because it was built from my own ideas and did exactly what I wanted it to do. The game was genuinely fun to play and I was never bored because it was a different playthrough every time (which is a very good thing considering how many times I had to run through the dang game before it actually started working). I found a true appreciation for functions while writing this code. My code is always a jumbled mess that I get lost in easily, but using functions in this assignment helped me organize everything nicely and transitioned from one section of code to another very smoothly, making everything very flexible to play with; functions also helped me loop the code in less delicate way from while and for loops. Although this assignment was executed with simple things like alerts and prompts, it’s still the project I’m most proud of.</p>

	<p>The most challenging assignment for me in this course was the holiday greeting card. The overall idea wasn’t too complicated to execute and pulling all the components together to make the actual card itself also was a concept that wasn’t all that hard to grasp, but I struggled a little bit with styling it. My problem with styling isn’t that it’s a difficult thing to do, but that I easily forget the code I need to use to properly style different pieces of content. I have a terrible memory in general and struggle remembering all the different lines of code you need to use to style a page without a reference. For example, I couldn’t remember how to style using hover on a submit button for the life of me. Half the time while writing css I couldn’t remember what products style selectors into specific values. I’m glad I had to struggle with this assignment because now I know how to style using hover. The repetition helps me remember how to write the proper code for css so I won’t forget in future projects.</p>
